# 2019-11-06 Meeting Minutes

Attendees: Elizabeth, Sailen, Sarah, Tobin

## Agenda and Notes

- Recap and discuss the ComBEE Meeting
  + Maybe we should include more about assembly theory (How assembly works)
  + Maybe we should switch to binning as our first topic (this seems to be a topic that more folks are interested in and have expertise to share in)
- Review actions items
- Next steps

Assembly Notes for lesson/lecture:
- Submit the assembly to run - hands on
- What is a good assembly - discussion/lecture/hands-on

Make sure that they know how to run the full pipeline from the beginning to end as part of the workshop.
If we only teach a part to test (make slides about the parts that they need to do before/after those sections)

Binning pipeline/paper we are thinking about using - https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/6/e00221-18
Modify the paper's pipeline to match our learning objectives (indvidual assemblies, depreplication, including dereplication with different binners)

## Action Items

Everyone: Look at the dataset in the paper - https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/6/e00221-18
Everyone: Think about learning objectives more
Everyone: Start thinking about pipeline
Elizabeth: Check where the data is and the size of the data, and think about where to put it (figshare, OSF, Datavault)


## Next Meeting
